# vMix Setup

Sofie can use vMix as an alternative to a studio setup involing an ATEM and CasparCG.

To enable the use of vMix, open your studio settings and add the blueprint configuration option 'Use vMix Workflow', make sure to set the value to true.

You will also need to add the option 'vMix Media Directory'. This needs to be the path to a folder containing all of your media for the show. For example: `c:\\users\\sofie\\Documents\\media`

It is also recommended that you use the CasparCG media scanner. In this case, the scanner would be running in `c:\\users\\sofie\\Documents`. This will report all available media to Sofie, and populate a list in your spreadsheets with the available media files.

## Setting up vMix

If you have set the vMix media directory correctly, then you will not need to add your videos and images to vMix, Sofie will do this for you - while the show is runnng!

Cameras, however, will need to be added manually - just make sure that the name you give them in your spreadsheets is exactly the same as what they are named in vMix.

### Transitions

Sofie will use transition button 4 to control transitions, so use the other buttons for your own custom transitions.

### Overlays

For sofie to be able to overlay graphics, you will need to open up the Overlay settings in vMix and set Overlay 4 to Fullscreen. You can also change the effect and effect duration here. Sofie will then use Overlay 4 as the overlay layer for all graphics.

### PIP

Sofie uses Overlay 3 for picure-in-picture. Set the type to 'PictureInPicture' and add an effect if wanted. You can then position the PIP source however you would like it.
